# 1.0 Getting Started

If you plan to develop applications using Steeltoe, you need to download and install the latest [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).

Additionally, while not required, we recommend installing one of the development tools ([Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) provided by Microsoft.

If you plan to develop with [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/) or [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) and do not already know them well, we recommend you first spend time working through some of the following tutorials from Microsoft:

* [Getting Started with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/getting-started)
* [Getting Started with C#](https://www.microsoft.com/net/tutorials/csharp/getting-started)

Note: Many of the Steeltoe packages can also be used with .NET Framework and ASP.NET 4 based applications. You are not required to target .NET/ASP.NET Core when using Steeltoe.

## 1.1 NuGet Feeds

When developing applications with Steeltoe, whether on .NET Core or .NET Framework, you need to pull the Steeltoe NuGet packages into your application.

To use the latest releases of Steeltoe, you can subscribe to any one of the following feeds, depending on your needs:

* [Release or Release Candidates](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/steeltoe)
* [Pre-release - Stable](https://www.myget.org/gallery/steeltoemaster)
* [Development - Less Stable](https://www.myget.org/gallery/steeltoedev)

The following example shows a NuGet.config file that you can edit and use when developing applications with Steeltoe:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="SteeltoeMaster" value="https://www.myget.org/F/steeltoemaster/api/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="SteeltoeDev" value="https://www.myget.org/F/steeltoedev/api/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

>NOTE: If you only want to use release or pre-release (RC) versions of Steeltoe, you need not make any changes to your NuGet.config file, as those are served from `nuget.org`.

## 1.2 Quick Starts

For many of the Steeltoe components, we provide Quick Start samples and a guide that describes how to quickly get a sample application up and running by using a particular Steeltoe component. A detailed breakdown of the sample code, describing how Steeltoe has been integrated into the app, is provided.

In many cases, these guides provide two ways of exercising the applications: one that describes how to create and run the application locally on your development machine and a second that describes running the application on Cloud Foundry.

For the Quick Starts in which we run the application locally, Java is required to run instances of some of the servers (such as Spring Cloud Config Server, Netflix Eureka Server, and others) on your machine. If you do not have Java available on your machine, you may want to install that now.

For the Quick Starts running on Cloud Foundry, you need access to a Cloud Foundry environment that has the appropriate services (such as Spring Cloud Config Server, Netflix Eureka Server, and others) installed. One option is to run [PCF Dev](https://docs.pivotal.io/pcf-dev/), the local developer version of Pivotal Cloud Foundry on your development machine. PCF Dev depends on Virtual Box, so, depending on your desktop operating system and configuration, you may not be able to use it.

Alternatively, you can sign up for a free trial account of [Pivotal Web Services](https://run.pivotal.io/), the hosted multi-tenant edition of [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://pivotal.io/platform). Note that, if you want to work solely with .NET framework applications that target the Windows operating system, you likely need access to a corporate Cloud Foundry environment, as neither of the above options currently support deploying Windows apps.

Regardless of which Cloud Foundry option you choose, in order to work with Cloud Foundry, you need to install the [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).

Finally, for all of the Quick Starts, you need to install the [GIT command line tools](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) so that you can fetch the Quick Start sample code and work with it on your computer.

# 2.0 Release Notes

A large focus of Steeltoe version 2.0 is compatibility with .NET Standard 2.0. As part of this initiative, virtually all packages have been reorganized and renamed to minimize hard dependencies on other libraries and also help differentiate between packages with full-framework support and those for .NET Core. Most Steeltoe libraries now include a package ending with "Base" that provides the majority of the functionality. Packages ending with "Core" provide extra methods for working with Microsoft's Dependency Injection Framework, with the naming intended to coincide with .NET Core development. Full-framework support to date has been focused on Autofac. The relevant Steeltoe packages have names ending in "Autofac".

## 2.1 CircuitBreaker

As described earlier in the general [release notes](#2-0-release-notes), Steeltoe Circuit breaker packages now have the following names: `Steeltoe.CircuitBreaker.HystrixBase`, `Steeltoe.CircuitBreaker.HystrixCore`, `Steeltoe.CircuitBreaker.HystrixAutofac`, `Steeltoe.CircuitBreaker.Hystrix.MetricsEventsCore`, and `Steeltoe.CircuitBreaker.Hystrix.MetricsStreamCore`.

## 2.2 Common

New for Steeltoe 2.0 is a set of libraries with code shared between our libraries. You can use this code as well, but these libraries are not likely to receive much attention in this documentation.

## 2.3 Configuration

In Steeltoe version 1.x, there are 3 packages for Configuration. As of 2.0.0, each of those packages now has a &ast;Base, a &ast;Core, and an &ast;Autofac (for example: `Steeltoe.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServerBase`, `Steeltoe.Extensions.Configuration.ConfigServerCore`, and so on) for a total of 9 packages. If you deploy your application to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, be sure to use the `Pivotal.&ast;` packages.

### Config Server Settings

Starting with version 1.1.0 of Steeltoe, you can now configure the timeout value the Steeltoe client uses when making Http requests to the Config Server.

### Config Server Vault support

Starting with version 1.1.0 of Steeltoe, the Config Server client is compatible with Spring Cloud and Spring Cloud Services Config Server deployments that support using Hashicorp Vault as back-ends.

### Known Issues

#### Unstructured data files

Unlike the Java version of the Config Server client, the Steeltoe client currently supports only property and yaml files, not plain text.

#### Client decryption option

Unless SSL/TLS is being used between the client and server, the Steeltoe client supports only clear text communication with the configuration server. Client decryption is not currently supported.

#### Server initiated reload

Currently, the client must initiate reloads. Steeltoe has not implemented handlers to listen for server change events.

## 2.4 Connectors

As of version 2.0.0, all of the individual connectors have been rolled up into a single package: `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorBase`. Helper methods for ASP.NET Core/Microsoft DI have been moved to `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.ConnectorCore`, `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.EF6Core` (Entity Framework 6), and `Steeltoe.CloudFoundry.Connector.EFCore` (Entity Framework Core). Version 2.0.0 now includes a Microsoft SQL Server Connector. Classes and namespaces related to RabbitMQ have been renamed from `*Rabbit` to `*RabbitMQ`.

### MySql Connector

Starting with version 1.0.1 of Steeltoe, the direct dependency on all of Oracle's MySql packages has been removed. This change lets the connector become more flexible in terms of which MySql ADO.NET providers and versions it supports. With this release, the connector is able to work with [Oracle's MySql Provider](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/) and the open source [MySqlConnector](https://mysql-net.github.io/MySqlConnector/) providers.

Additionally, as it relates to Entity Framework support, the connector has been updated to support [Oracle's Entity Framework Provider](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/) and the open source [Pomelo Entity Framework Provider](https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql).

For more detail on how to use these providers, see the MySql connector documentation.

>CAUTION: This is a BREAKING change, as it now requires that you MUST explicitly include the packages and versions of the MySql/Entity framework code you wish to use in your application.

### Postgres Connector

Starting with version 1.0.1 of Steeltoe, the direct dependency on the open source Npgsql package has been removed. This change lets the connector become more flexible in what Postgres ADO.NET providers and versions it supports.

For more detail on how to use the connector, see the Postgres connectors documentation.

>CAUTION: This is a BREAKING change, as it now requires that you MUST explicitly include the packages and versions of the Postgres/Entity framework code wish to use in your application.

### RabbitMQ Connector

In version 2.0.0, all namespaces, classes and methods with `Rabbit` in the name were changed to `RabbitMQ` (for example, `AddRabbitConnection()` is now `AddRabbitMQConnection()`)

Starting with version 1.0.1 of Steeltoe, the direct dependency on the open source RabbitMQ Client package has been removed. This change lets the connector become more flexible in what version of the client it supports.

For more detail on how to use the connector, see the RabbitMQ connectors documentation.

>CAUTION: This is a BREAKING change, as it now requires that you MUST explicitly include the packages and versions of the RabbitMQ code you wish to use in your application.

Also, with this release, the connector has been updated to properly work with SSL/TLS based connections. Prior to this release, the connector did not support using the 'amqps' URL scheme.

### Redis Connector

Starting with version 2.0.0 of Steeltoe, the direct dependencies on Redis packages have been removed. The Steeltoe connector works with the StackExchange libraries or `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Redis`. You include the package and version you prefer and use the appropriate methods to connect it. See the Redis Connector documentation for more information.

## 2.5 Discovery

In version 1.x of Steeltoe, there were three packages. In version 2.0.0 there are six packages:

* `Steeltoe.Discovery.ClientAutofac`
* `Steeltoe.Discovery.ClientCore`
* `Steeltoe.Discovery.Eureka.ClientBase`
* `Pivotal.Discovery.ClientCore`
* `Pivotal.Discovery.ClientAutofac`
* `Pivotal.Discovery.Eureka.ClientBase`.

Be sure to use the `Pivotal.&ast;` packages if you deploy your application to Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Version 2.0.0 also includes support for dynamic update of configuration options.

### Eureka Version

Steeltoe has implemented a [Eureka 1.0 client](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki), not a 2.0 client. Eureka 2.0 is still a work in progress and is expected to have significant updates to its architecture and public API. At some point in time, we may examine a 2.0 implementation.

### Eureka AWS Support

The Eureka client for Java contains features that enable operation on AWS. The Steeltoe version does not currently implement those features. Instead, this version has been optimized for Cloud Foundry environments. We may look at adding AWS cloud features at a future point in time.

### Eureka Client Configuration

Not all configuration properties found in the Java client are available for configuration. Those that are supported and provided by the Steeltoe implementation have been documented in this guide.

### Cloud Foundry C2C Support

Starting with version 1.1.0 of Steeltoe, the Steeltoe Eureka client lets you configure what hostname/address gets registered with the Eureka server for your service registrations. This feature is provided by using a new setting: `spring:cloud:discovery:registrationMethod`.  By using this setting, you can now make use of Cloud Foundry Container to Container (C2C) networking support.

## 2.6 Logging

As of version 2.0.0, `Steeltoe.Extensions.Logging.CloudFoundry` is called `Steeltoe.Extensions.Logging.DynamicLogger`

## 2.7 Management

As of version 2.0.0, all of the individual management endpoints have been rolled up into a single package: `Steeltoe.Management.EndpointBase`. Helper methods for ASP.NET Core/Microsoft DI have been moved to `Steeltoe.Management.EndpointCore`. Convenience helpers to set up all endpoints at once are available in `Steeltoe.Management.CloudFoundryCore`. Additionally in 2.0.0, actuators identify themselves to PCF as Steeltoe, resulting in a Steeltoe icon in Pivotal Apps Manager. Also, certificate validation can be disabled on management endpoints.

## 2.8 Security

New features for Steeltoe Security 2.0.0 include a client for [CredHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub), support for using Cloud Foundry as an authentication provider in .NET Framework 4.x applications, and a JWT Provider for WCF applications.
